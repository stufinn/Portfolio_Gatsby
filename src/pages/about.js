        Hi! <span role="img">ðŸ‘‹</span> I am a{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">software developer</span> based out of
        a beautiful little town called Sioux Lookout in Northwestern Ontario.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutPage__text">
        I have a passion for creating{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">interesting</span>,{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">helpful</span>, and hopefully even{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">beautiful</span> things with{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">code</span>. Iâ€™ve got a background in
        web development (surprise, surprise), biological sciences (Honours
        Bsc.), international development (minor), and environmental studies
        (Masters). I am also a certified professional project manager (PMP),
        when my credential isnâ€™t lapsed that is (<span role="img">ðŸ˜¬</span>â€¦ Iâ€™m
        on it!).

      <p className="aboutPage__text">
        The websites that I create are often inspired by{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">nature</span> and{" "}
        <span className="aboutPage--emph">minimalistic design</span>. I love
        building products that look amazing and are easy to use. If you are
